Remaining issues and future improvements
- It's still slow. It'd be nice if it were all javascript, but maybe that's for another project.
- The colors "red", "yellow", etc. don't look like what they sound like.
- Should implement some cool sequences.
- It seems unrealible, especially switching between devices.
- The default settings aren't very good.
